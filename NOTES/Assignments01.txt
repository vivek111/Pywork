Write a program which accepts a number n between 1 and 100 from the user and displays all numbers between 1 and 1000 not divisible by n.

We define twin primes as a pair of prime numbers which differ by 2. Write a program to display the first 25 twin primes.

Two integers are said to be coprime (or relatively prime) if they have no common positive divisor other than 1 or, equivalently, if their gcd is 1. Write a program which accepts an integer n and displays all coprime pairs (a, b) where a and b are positive integers less than n.

Positive Integers a, b, c are pythagorean triplets if a2 + b2 = c2 . Write a program which displays all pythagorean triplets (a, b, c) if c < 100.

Write a program to sum the elements of a sequence of integers, terminated by a negative value, excluding the negative value

Develop and test a program that determines how many breaths and how many heartbeats a person has had in their life. The average respiration (breath) rate of people varies with age. Use the breath rates given below for use in your program,
Infant                  Breaths per Minute
1–4 years               25–60
5–14 years              20–30
15–18 years             15–25
                        11–23

For heart rate, use an average of 67.5 beats per second.



Password Encryption/Decryption program

create a encryption list [('a','m'), ('b','o'), ('c','q'), ('d','s'), ('e','u'), ('f','w'), ('g','y')]

program will ask to enter password
encrypt and show password
later enter encrypted password
decrypt to obtain original password
